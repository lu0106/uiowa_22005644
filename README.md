### The numbers of the estimated hours and the actual hours.

I expect to spend 3 hours to complete this task.

20 minute thinking steps

1. Write a good framework
2. Let the user enter a file name
3. According to the file name to judge whether it is Admission, Scholarship or error
4. Determine whether there is already a folder of the current day
5. Determine whether there is a duplicate ID and extract it
6. Output a file with students with duplicate IDs

### Comments (Optional). You can describe the following:

a. The assumptions you made during implementation.
Suppose need to compare with the previous ID. Admission and Scholarship may not be entered on the same day, but they can be sent in the same envelope.

b. The problems you came across, and how you solved them.
When the user enters the file and completes it, return to the continue input screen. My idea is that it can be solved by using multithreading, because the program can be executed in the background, and the user can continue to input, which has a good user experience.
